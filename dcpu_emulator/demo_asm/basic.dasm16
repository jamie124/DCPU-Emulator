; Set A and B to our numbers
; You may change these and see
; how the outcome will change
SET A, 33
SET B, 12

; Compute A % 2, which is 0 if
; even and 1 if odd
MOD A, 2

; Do the same to B
MOD B, 2

; Copy the value of A to C
SET C, A

; Since the sum of two numbers
; is only odd if one number is
; even and the other is odd,
; we can use XOR here:
; Get the exclusive or of C
; (which is now the same as A)
; and B
XOR C, B

; Finish
